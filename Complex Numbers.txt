Experiment no. 1

Problem Statement :

/*Implement a class Complex which represents the Complex Number data type. 
Implement
the following operations:
1. Constructor (including a default constructor which creates the complex number
0+0i).
2. Overloaded operator+ to add two complex numbers.
3. Overloaded operator* to multiply two complex numbers.
4. Overloaded << and >> to print and read Complex Numbers.*/


program code:


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class complex
{
float x;
float y;
public:
 complex()   // constructor which creates complex numbers
{
x=0;
y=0;
}

// Operator overloading: + and *
complex operator+(complex);
complex operator*(complex);

// friend functions are used to overload the input (>>) operator
friend istream &operator >>(istream &input,complex &t) // friend func for i/p operator overloading ">>" (extraction) 
{
cout<<"Enter the real part";
input>>t.x;
cout<<"Enter the imaginary part";
input>>t.y;
}
friend ostream &operator <<(ostream &output,complex &t) // friend func for o/p operator overloading "<<" (insertion) 
{
output<<t.x<<"+"<<t.y<<"i\n";
}
};
complex complex::operator+(complex c)  // the + operator overloaded to add two complex no.
{
complex temp;
temp.x=x+c.x;
temp.y=y+c.y;
return(temp);
}
complex complex::operator*(complex c)   // the * operator overloaded to multiply two complex no.
{
complex temp2;
temp2.x=(x*c.x)-(y*c.y);
temp2.y=(y*c.x)+(x*c.y);
return (temp2);
}
int main()
{
complex c1,c2,c3,c4;
 cout<<"Default constructor value=\n";
 cout<<c1;
cout<<"\nEnter the 1st number\n";
cin>>c1;
cout<<"\nEnter the 2nd number\n";
cin>>c2;
c3=c1+c2;
c4=c1*c2;
cout<<"\nThe first number is ";
cout<<c1;
cout<<"\nThe second number is ";
cout<<c2;
cout<<"\nThe addition is ";
cout<<c3;
cout<<"\nThe multiplication is ";
cout<<c4;
return 0;
}


Output: 

Default constructor value=
0+0i

Enter the 1st number
Enter the real part5
Enter the imaginary part6

Enter the 2nd number
Enter the real part7
Enter the imaginary part8

The first number is 5+6i

The second number is 7+8i

The addition is 12+14i

The multiplication is -13+82i

Algorithm

1. Design a class Complex which represents the Complex Number data type.
2. Create a custructor which creates the complex number 0+0i
Complex(): real(0), imag(0){ }
3. Use operator overloading to overload operator+ to add two complex numbers.
Complex operator + (Complex c2)
4. Use operator overloading to overload operator* to multiply two complex numbers.
Complex operator * (Complex c3)
5. Use operator overloading to overload operator<< and >> to print and read Complex Numbers.
friend ostream& operator << (ostream &out, Complex &c); //overloading '<<' operator
friend istream& operator >> (istream &in, Complex &c); //overloading '>>' operator
